INSTALLING

Download CubeModLoader.fip from https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/Cube-World-Mod-Launcher/releases and place it in your Cube World folder (should be Steam\steamapps\common\Cube World). Make a folder called "Mods" (without quotes) in your Cube World folder and put cubegression.dll in that Mods folder.

ABOUT

Each artifact now gives one of these boosts:

Health boost is +10hp
Armor boost is +1
Damage boost is +1
Haste boost is +0.075
Regen boost is +0.1
Crit boost is +0.075
Resistance boost is +1

The artifacts still boost lamp radius, sailing speed, etc but that's just not shown. So each artifact boosts a combat stat and one of the original movement boost as well. Here is what boosts go together:

Health, Climbing
Armor, Swimming
Damage, Diving
Haste, Riding
Regen, Gliding
Crit, Sailing
Resistance, Lamp radius

Thanks to Aris for his memory patcher functions. Thanks to zatochu for correcting the names of the boosts and removing other features and to ChrisMiuchiz for his mod loader. Thanks to Geo for his cheat table and help along the way.
