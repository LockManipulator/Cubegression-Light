Credits to ArisHacksTV for his leveling mod as this is just a stripped down and slightly altered version of it. Thanks to zatochu for correcting the names of the boosts and removing other features. Thanks to Geo for his cheat table and help along the way. And thanks to Nichiren for helping out with region unlocking specific special items.

INSTALLING

Put the FreeImage.dll, cubemod.dll, and config.txt into your Cube World folder (where the .exe is), should be Steam\steamapps\common\Cube World. Click yes to overwrite if needed and you're set. 

TROUBLESHOOTING

If the mod doesn't work, download the Visual Studio C++ Redistributable from: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads AND Visual Studio 2019 (make sure you check the development for desktop with C++ module) then restart your computer and run the game again.

MODDING

The cubemod folder is the source files. In Visual Studio 2019, open>open folder, then select the cubemod folder. There you can view and edit anything to your heart's desire. Ctrl+shift+B will compile and you'll find the cubemod.dll under cubemod/bin.
