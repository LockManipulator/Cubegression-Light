INSTALLING  

Download CubeModLoader.fip from https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/Cube-World-Mod-Launcher/releases and place it in your Cube World folder (should be Steam\steamapps\common\Cube World). Make a folder called "Mods" (without quotes) in your Cube World folder and put cubegression.dll in that Mods folder.  

ABOUT  

Each artifact now gives one of these boosts:  

Health boost is +10hp  
Armor boost is +1  
Damage boost is +1  
Haste boost is +0.075  
Regen boost is +0.25  
Crit boost is +0.75  
Resistance boost is +1  

The artifacts still boost lamp radius and sailing speed but that's just not shown. So each artifact boosts a combat stat and one of the original movement boost as well. Here is what boosts go together:  

Health, Climbing  
Armor, Swimming  
Damage, Diving  
Haste, Riding  
Regen, Gliding  
Crit, Sailing  
Resistance, Lamp radius  

Only lamp radius and sailing speed actually get boosted, since the rest are broken (same with vanilla game).  

Thanks to Aris for his memory patcher functions. Thanks to zatochu for correcting the names of the boosts and removing other features and to ChrisMiuchiz for his mod loader. Thanks to Geo for his cheat table and help along the way.
